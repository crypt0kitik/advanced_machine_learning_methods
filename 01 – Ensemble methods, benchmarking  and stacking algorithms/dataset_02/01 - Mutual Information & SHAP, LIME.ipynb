    "Mutual Information\n",
    "Purpose: Identify relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
    "What it does: Mutual Information (MI) measures the amount of information one variable provides about another. It captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies.\n",
    "Features with high MI scores are considered more important for predicting the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Explain model predictions by attributing the contribution of each feature.\n",
    "What it does:SHAP is based on cooperative game theory (Shapley values).\n",
    "It explains the output of a machine learning model by distributing the modelâ€™s prediction across its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)\n",
    "Purpose: Explain individual predictions of a machine learning model.\n",
    "What it does: LIME explains the prediction for a specific instance by fitting a simple, interpretable model (like linear regression) to approximate the behavior of the complex model around that instance."
