- Group Discussions: Get small groups of students together to talk about their experiences and what they expect from the course or the degree in general.
","Group Similar Students: Use computer tools to put students into groups based on what they have in common.
Figure out the most important things that influence how students act in the class.
Read through what students said in interviews and focus groups and find common themes.
Group students based on how involved they are, how they learn, and what jobs they want in the future
","Pick Important Traits: Choose 5-7 things that describe each ""fake student,"" like their age, goals, challenges, and how they like to learn.
Make up a story for each ""fake student,"" giving them a name, a background, and describing how they usually act.

Use a Template: Keep all the ""fake student"" profiles organized and consistent.
","Ask new students to pick which ""fake student"" is most like them. If most students can find a match, we're on the right track. this is to be done at the beginning of the academic year and useful for all courses.

 Ask other teachers if the ""fake students"" seem like real students they've taught.
