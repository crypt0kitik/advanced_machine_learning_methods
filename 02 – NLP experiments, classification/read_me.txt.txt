Classic ML – Naïve-Bayes –classification
Neural network approach – BERT or some other base model used


Ideas for optimizations for this exercise project (optional):
 Stopword removal and other text data processing/optimization 
methods (e.g. n-gram)
 Stemming or lemmatization
 Data augmentation (synonym replacement etc.)
 Different vectorization algorithms, like TfidVectorizer 
 Different tokenization strategies and methods
 Hyperparameter and algorithm (also neural network) tuning
 Different base models / embeddings
o DistilBERT, roBERTa, ALBERT, FastText, Word2Vec, GloVe etc.
